Chapter 2: Why humans sweat: An evolutionary perspective

A. Thermoregulation

1. Heat dissipation in humans compared to other animals
  a. Comparison of cooling mechanisms in animals
    i. Panting in dogs and other mammals
    ii. Vasodilation in the skin of some mammals and birds
    iii. Water evaporation in reptiles and amphibians
  b. Advantages of human heat dissipation methods
  i. Greater endurance in hot environments
  ii. Lower risk of overheating during physical activities
2. The role of eccrine sweat glands
  a. Function and distribution of eccrine glands
    i. Regulation of body temperature through evaporative cooling
    ii. Abundant presence in human skin, particularly on palms, soles, and forehead
  b. Sweat production process
    i. Activation by the sympathetic nervous system
    ii. Sweat secretion and evaporation
  c. Eccrine glands and human adaptability
    i. Acclimatization to different climates
    ii. Response to changes in ambient temperature and humidity

B. Advantages of sweating in human evolution

1. Efficient cooling system enabling long-distance running
  a. The "persistence hunting" hypothesis
    i. Human ancestors chasing prey until exhaustion
    ii. Improved endurance due to effective thermoregulation
  b. Evolutionary pressures favoring sweat-based cooling
    i. Climate changes and the expansion of savannas
    ii. The need for increased mobility in early hominids
  c. Physiological adaptations for long-distance running
    i. Musculoskeletal changes
    ii. Increased lung capacity
2. Hairlessness and the development of sweat glands
  a. The loss of body hair in human evolution
    i. Theories explaining reduced hairiness
      1. Ectoparasite avoidance
      2. Sexual selection
    ii. Timeline of hair loss in hominid evolution
  b. Connection between hairlessness and sweating
    i. Increased effectiveness of evaporative cooling
    ii. Enhanced heat dissipation due to exposed skin
  c. Trade-offs of hairlessness
    i. Increased vulnerability to sunburn and skin damage
    ii. The role of melanin in skin protection

C. Unique aspects of human sweating

1. Distribution and density of sweat glands
  a. Variability in sweat gland density across the human body
    i. Factors affecting distribution patterns
      1. Genetics
      2. Individual differences
    ii. Implications for heat dissipation efficiency
  b. Comparison of human sweat gland distribution with other primates
    i. Differences in eccrine gland density
    ii. Role of apocrine glands in other primates
2. The composition of human sweat
  a. Main components of human sweat
    i. Water
    ii. Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium)
    iii. Trace elements (zinc, copper, iron)
    iv. Metabolites and proteins
  b. Variability in sweat composition
    i. Factors influencing sweat composition
      1. Hydration status
      2. Diet
      3. Exercise intensity
3. Acclimatization
    ii. Implications for electrolyte balance and rehydration
  c. Comparison of human sweat composition with other animals
    i. Differences in electrolyte concentrations
    ii. Unique metabolites and proteins in human sweat



## Psychological Influences

To be clear, unless you are a dualist, psychology has a physical reality -- something cannot actually be 'just in your head' in the sense that it is not real. 
But what we mean to explain in this section is that HH in some can be exacerbated by certain social situations, and may be comorbid with anxiety disorders. 
However, I and many other HH sufferers sweat abnormally even in the safety and comfort of our home, when stress and anxiety levels are at their lowest.
