# Hyperhidrosis: Causes and types {#causes}

A. Definition and prevalence

1. Definition of hyperhidrosis
  a. Excessive and uncontrollable sweating
  b. Disruption of daily activities and quality of life
2. Prevalence of hyperhidrosis
  a. Global prevalence rates
  b. Variability across age groups and geographical regions
3. Impact of hyperhidrosis on individuals
  a. Physical discomfort and skin issues
  b. Emotional and psychological effects


B. Primary hyperhidrosis

1. Definition and characteristics
  a. Idiopathic excessive sweating
  b. No underlying medical cause
2. Focal hyperhidrosis
  a. Description and common areas affected
    i. Palmar (hands)
    ii. Plantar (feet)
    iii. Axillary (underarms)
    iv. Craniofacial (head and face)
  b. Onset and progression patterns
3. Genetic factors
  a. Family history and heritability
  b. Identification of potential candidate genes
  c. Ongoing research on the genetic basis of hyperhidrosis
4. Overactive sympathetic nervous system
  a. Role of sympathetic activation in primary hyperhidrosis
  b. Theories on why the sympathetic nervous system becomes overactive
  c. Potential therapeutic targets for treatment

C. Secondary hyperhidrosis

1. Definition and characteristics
  a. Excessive sweating due to an underlying medical condition or medication
  b. Generalized or localized sweating patterns
2. Underlying medical conditions
  a. Infections (e.g., tuberculosis, HIV)
  b. Endocrine disorders (e.g., hyperthyroidism, diabetes)
  c. Neurological disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury)
  d. Autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus)
  e. Malignancies (e.g., lymphoma, carcinoid tumors)
3. Medications
  a. Common medications causing hyperhidrosis
    i. Antidepressants
    ii. Antipsychotics
    iii. Anticholinesterases
    iv. Opioids
  b. Mechanisms of medication-induced hyperhidrosis
4. Hormonal imbalances
  a. Menopause and hot flashes
  b. Andropause in men
  c. Effects of hormonal imbalances on sweat gland function

D. Diagnosing hyperhidrosis

1. Patient history and physical examination
  a. Identifying the extent and severity of sweating
  b. Assessing the impact on daily life
2. Diagnostic tests
  a. Gravimetric sweat test
  b. Starch-iodine test
  c. Thermoregulatory sweat test (TST)
3. Differential diagnosis
  a. Ruling out secondary causes of hyperhidrosis
  b. Identifying any underlying medical conditions or medication use
4. Determining the type and severity of hyperhidrosis
  a. Classification systems and severity scales
  b. Guiding treatment decisions based on diagnosis
