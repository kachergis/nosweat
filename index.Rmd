description: "Many of those facing excessive sweating are unaware that their condition is a medical one (hyperhidrosis), and simply try to cope with it untreated, which can lead to great stress and anxiety in a variety of everyday situations, from shaking hands to manual labor or any social situation. Even once they know the name of this disorder, figuring out a treatment plan that works consistently without debilitating side effects is a daunting challenge."
