# Introduction: Why we sweat {#intro}

## A human history of sweat
Sweat sets us apart from most animals: humans have the most pervasive sweat (eccrine) system.
Why do we need such an cooling system? 
One hypothesis is that our ancestors were persistence hunters, meaning that they would chase and track prey like gazelles for long distances on the savannah. 
Although we cannot outrun gazelles and other prey for short distances, we have more stamina, and they will become exhausted after running several miles, scared for their lives.
After tracking their prey and eventually catching up, our ancestors may have only had to deliver a coups de grace to the frightened beasts.

Could diversity in our ancestors' climates or diets have further impacted our present sweating behavior?


## How much sweat is too much?

### Too much of a good thing: Hyperhidrosis

Symptoms
Excessive sweating is a medical condition characterized by sweating in amounts greater than required for thermoregulation. It can affect any part of the body, but commonly occurs in the armpits, hands, and feet. People with hyperhidrosis may experience sweating that is so severe that it interferes with daily activities, such as work or social interactions, leading to embarrassment, social anxiety, and decreased self-esteem.

### Causes
The exact cause of hyperhidrosis is not known, but it is believed to be related to overactive sweat glands. The condition can be inherited, and it often runs in families. It can also be caused by certain medical conditions such as diabetes, thyroid problems, menopause, and certain infections.


### The impact of excessive sweating on social life
Excessive sweating can have a significant impact on a person's social life. People with hyperhidrosis may feel embarrassed or ashamed of their sweating, which can cause them to avoid social situations or activities that may trigger sweating. This can lead to social isolation and negatively affect relationships with friends, family, and romantic partners. The fear of sweating can also impact career choices and performance, as people may avoid certain jobs or work environments where sweating is more likely to occur.

### The psychological effects of hyperhidrosis
Hyperhidrosis can have a profound effect on a person's mental health. The embarrassment and social isolation caused by excessive sweating can lead to depression, anxiety, and decreased self-esteem. People with hyperhidrosis may also experience feelings of shame and inadequacy, which can impact their overall quality of life. The psychological impact of hyperhidrosis should not be underestimated, and seeking psychological support may be an important part of managing the condition.


### Treatments
There are several treatments available for hyperhidrosis, including antiperspirants, medications, and surgery. Antiperspirants containing aluminum chloride can be applied to the affected area to reduce sweating. Prescription medications, such as anticholinergics, beta-blockers, and benzodiazepines, can also be used to reduce sweating. In severe cases, surgical procedures such as sympathectomy, which involves cutting the nerves that stimulate sweating, can be performed.

- palmar-plantar hyperhidrosis

## Anecdotes

After finding relief for my sweaty hands, I took up social dancing and became more aware of how many others suffer from sweaty hands in the US: I estimate as many as 1 in 15 of my dance partners would have at least mildly sweaty palms. 
And just think--those are the ones who still chose to go dancing!
However, I was more surprised after attending a swing dance event in Stockholm, Sweden, where I found that nearly half of the partners I danced with had hands that rivaled mine in sweatiness.
Granted, this was a single event and I danced with no more than a dozen partners, but this suspicious coincidence of so many dancers suffering HH in Stockholm, along with my family's northern European heritage led me to the hypothesis that HH may be more prevalent in some populations -- a genetic basis for HH.

Coupled with this observation is the anecdata that I've also met a few people of Mediterranean descent who face the opposite issue: they sweat too little, a condition dubbed hypohidrosis by doctors.


### Hypohidrosis (inadequate sweating)

Symptoms
Hypohidrosis is a medical condition characterized by reduced or absent sweating, which can lead to overheating, dehydration, and heatstroke. The symptoms of hypohidrosis include dry skin, heat intolerance, dizziness, and rapid heartbeat.

Causes
Hypohidrosis can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic disorders, nerve damage, and skin damage. It can also be caused by certain medications, such as antihistamines and diuretics, and medical conditions such as diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and some types of cancer.

Treatments
The treatment of hypohidrosis depends on the underlying cause. In some cases, treatment may not be necessary, and simply avoiding extreme temperatures and staying hydrated may be sufficient. For those with more severe symptoms, medications such as cholinergic agonists may be prescribed to stimulate sweating. In some cases, artificial sweat may be used to keep the skin moist and reduce the risk of overheating. Additionally, treatment of any underlying medical conditions may help to alleviate the symptoms of hypohidrosis.


## Outline of the book

The outline of this book is as follows. 
In `{#science}` the basic science of sweating is explained, from how sweat glands work to the nervous system that controls them.
In Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).
