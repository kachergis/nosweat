## To others with hyperhidrosis

In comparison to many other medical conditions, hyperhidrosis is quite under-researched and not well understood, and I hope we can work together to help change that. 
Towards that end, I invite you to participate in an ongoing anonymous informal survey about your experience with hyperhidrosis:

The aggregated results of this survey will be used to continuously update the contents of this book.

## To our friends and family

We thank you for taking our concerns about excessive sweating seriously, and for being patient with us as we try to figure out ways to mitigate its effects.

## To the medical community
